BUILD REQUIREMENTS

1. Mac OS X
The makefiles are configured to build on an x86 or x86-64 system in
32 bit mode.
This is to be compatible with the qt libraries and to be distributable to
no x86 systems.

2. Xcode
This is available on the OS install disk, or can be downloaded from
    http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html

3. Qt
Qt is available from:
    http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
The very latest version might not work, but older versions are available from:
    ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/
    http://ftp3.ie.freebsd.org/pub/trolltech/pub/qt/source/
The packages qt-mac-opensource-*.dmg use the carbon API.
The packages qt-mac-cocoa-opensource-*.dmg use the cocoa API.
The packages qt-sdk-mac-opensource-*.dmg provide the full Qt development
environment, but this is not necessary for building EW.

Note: lapack and libxml2 are bundled with Mac OS X, so they impose no
additional build or runtime requirements.

1. Mac OS X
As above.

2. Qt
As above.
