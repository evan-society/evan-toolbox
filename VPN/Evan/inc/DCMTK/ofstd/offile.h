/** this class provides a simple C++ encapsulation layer for stdio FILE pointers.
 *  All stdio functions on files are directly mapped into member functions.
 *  The handling of large files (64 bit file systems) is transparent. Instead
 *  of type off_t, fseek() and ftell() use offile_off_t which is a 64 bit type
 *  if available on the underlying platform. Similarly, getpos() and setpos() use
 *  type offile_fpos_t, which is defined appropriately.
 *  This class provides both fclose() and pclose(), but these are equivalent -
 *  the code always closes pipes with pclose() and files with fclose().
 *  Finally, an abstraction for errno is provided. Error codes should always
 *  be retrieves using methods getLastError() and getLastErrorString() which
 *  on Unix platforms are based on errno and strerror/strerror_r, but may be based
 *  on other mechanisms on platforms where errno does not exist.

/*
 * CVS/RCS Log:
 * $Log: offile.h,v $
 * Revision 1.9  2009-08-10 07:52:09  meichel
 * Some modifications needed to make class OFFile compile on MinGW.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2009-03-12 11:37:54  joergr
 * Fixed various Doxygen API documentation issues.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2009-02-13 12:56:18  joergr
 * Added private undefined copy constructor and assignment operator in order to
 * avoid compiler warnings (reported by gcc with additional flags).
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2009-01-30 13:49:01  joergr
 * Replaced checking of macro WIN32 by _WIN32.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2008-05-29 10:37:11  meichel
 *  Fixed compile error on Cygwin where no wide-char FILE functions are available
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2008-02-07 16:57:46  meichel
 * Class OFFile now makes use of HAVE_CHARP_STRERROR_R to use the
 *   correct version of strerror_r.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2007/06/06 13:55:58  onken
 * Fixed compilation for Mac OS X with making large file support function calls
 * implicit for this OS (Mac OS X misleadingly defines _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE).
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2007/02/19 16:03:47  meichel
 * Added constructor to class OFFile that takes FILE * as argument.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2006/08/21 12:40:44  meichel
 * Added new class OFFile that provides a simple encapsulation layer for
 *   FILE based stream I/O and, in particular, provides long file support
 *   (LFS) if available on the underlying operating system platform through
 *   a single API.
 *
