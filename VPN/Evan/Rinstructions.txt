R Node

The Evan Toolkit can be linked against R.
It is important that the version of R on the computer running the Evan Toolkit is the same it as was linked against (currently 2.10.1).

For the R node to work:
	R has to be installed on the computer.
	The R.exe needs to be found in the path
	The R_HOME varible needs to be set.

R can be downloaded from here:
	http://www.r-project.org/

To set the path in Windows XP
Select Start->Control Panel->System
Select Advanced tab
Click Environment Variables

Select path under System Variables and click edit.
Add the path to R.exe to the path variable (typcally something like "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.xx.x\bin")

To create R_HOME variable click New under System Variables
set the name to R_HOME
set the value to the R home directory (something like "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.xx.x")
