Modification to Toolbox software by Roger Phillips
==================================================

Known bugs
----------
1) gpa::getsymmetrymatrix - bugs in rotation, translation, see Helgi, POH, FB to find precise
   meaning oi symmetry matrix.
2) gpa::gpacalculate overwrites input specimens object - this is wrong

To do
-----
1) Need to add dialogue for PCA node (centre, scale).
2) Need to add dialogue box for choosing PC warp variable and Specimen for warping.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

18/1/9 Commited cpp and h file changes below for 7) to subversion server.

6/1/2009 Athens Demo status
   View of selected specimen and surface - OK
   View of selected GPA specimen and surface - OK
   View of of morph of 2 selected GPA specimen and surface - OK

8) Used node wizard to create a new PC Warper node. Code up and tested PC warper node.
   Need to add dialogue box for choosing PC warp variable and Specimen for warping.

7) Finished coding PCA node. Need to add dialogue for node (centre, scale).

a) Modified WarpSurface class so that it includes optionally the reference landmarks for the
reference shape and the target landmarks for the target shape. Normally if warping between
two known shapes both will be used. If warping from a base shape using a vector then normally
the target shape will not be used.

b) Modified the WarperNode so that it stores the landmarks in the WarpSurface for the reference
   and target shape.

c) Modified the WarperViewerNode so that it displays the landmarks of the WarpSurface for
   the reference and target shape if provided.

d) Modified the WarperViewerNode to provide a menu bar option to enable / disable the display
   of the reference and target shape. Introduce a View menu bar option for this and moved
  "Set Stereo" menu item from File to View.

Files modified: WarpSurface.h; WarperNode.cpp; WarperViewerNode.h&cpp;
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/1/9 Commited cpp and h file changes below for 4) & 5) to subversion server.

1/1/2009 Athens Demo status
   View of selected specimen and surface - OK
   View of selected GPA specimen and surface - OK
   View of of morph of 2 selected GPA specimen and surface - nothing appears in view window.

5) 1/1/2009
Added debugging code. Defined a global debug file dbgfile.txt (evan.cpp). Added debug code to
NodeSelect.cpp and gpa.cpp. Debug code is controlled by flags local to each compiled file.

4) 1/1/2009
GetTransformationMatrix - fixed numerous problems
a) Transformation is required between input specimen coordinates and its GPA coordinates.
   Code was producing transformation between GPA coordinates and procrustes mean.
   Needed to take a copy of specimen input coordinates.
b) Code was creating a transformation matrix for vector coordinates but matrix for column
   coordinates was required.
c) Transformation was not scaled or translated correctly,
Above required fixes to gpa.cpp & h, NodeSelect.cpp and surface.h  
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commited pp and h file changes below for 1) to 3) to subversion server.

28/12/2008 Athens Demo status
   View of selected specimen and surface - OK
   View of selected GPA specimen and surface - scaling seems about right; landmark scale and surface scale
   seem about right. However, they do not coincide. Rotation seems wrong. Need to investigate.


3) 28/12/2008
Landmarks drawn by viewer always had a radius of 1.0. 
WarperViewerNode.cpp: Changed code so that radius of landmarks is set to 1/200 * max (x_range, y_range, z_range)
of landmark coordinates. Worked OK.

2) 28/12/2008
gpa.cpp: getTransformationMatrix returned incorrect matrix. It did not include scaling and the translation coefficients
were unscaled and unrotated. Changed code to do this. Seems OK but not tested thoroughly.


1) 28/12/2008
PCA and GPA would not compile together. dgesvd.h contained protocols of functions as well as code. Created dgesvd.cpp
and moved code from header file to it.
Also moved internal function protocols from header file to cpp file.
Uncommented code in pca.cpp that would not compile because of problem with dgesvd files.
Changed all makefiles to include dgesvd.cpp. Not sure if I needed to do this, but everything seems to work.
