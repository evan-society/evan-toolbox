2010-10-12  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Renamed all classes, e.g:
        EW_Dataflow_Node -> ew::DataflowNode
    * Renamed all files, e.g:
        dataflow_node.h -> DataflowNode.h
    * Renamed
        ew::DataflowArray3Explicit -> ew::DataflowArray3E
        ew::DataflowCurve3Explicit -> ew::DataflowCurve3E

        ew::Dig3Space::project
        ew::Form3::search_superset
        ew::Form3::set_superset
        ew::DataflowForm3::set_superset
        ew::Dig3Space::set_superset


2010-07-04  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Replaced EW_Dig3_Space::get_index() with constant EW_Dig3_Space::index.
    * Replaced EW_Form3_IOError, EW_Dig3_Tableau_IOError, EW_Curve3_IOError and
    EW_Surface3_IOError with EW_Error_IO.
    Added EW_Error_Runtime.
    * Added EW_Dig3::SPACE_TEMPLATE and EW_DIG3::SPACE_SPECIMEN.
    * EW_Dig3_View now inherits EW_View3_Widget instead of having to be
    associated with a separately created EW_View3_Widget.
    * Added EW_View3_Pick and EW_View3_Widget::pickv.
    EW_View3_Widget::pick is deprecated and will be removed later.
    * Added a member EW_View3_Item::type and an optional argument in
    the constructors of classes derived from EW_View3_Item to initialize it.
    Also added a corresponding enum EW_Dig3_View::item_t.
    * Removed EW_Dataflow_Curve3_Explicit::get_filename and
    EW_Dataflow_Surface3_Explicit::get_filename.
    * Replaced EW_Dataflow_Netork::cycle_t with unsigned long, which is
    what it was a typedef for.


2010-03-24  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

   * Renamed
       EW_Dig3::TableauFlags -> EW_Dig3::tableau_flags_t
       EW_Form3::StateType -> EW_Form3::state_t
       EW_Form3::PointType -> EW_Form3::point_t
       EW_View3_Landmarks::SymbolType -> EW_View3_Landmarks::symbol_t


2010-02-24  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

   * Added, to support curves:
       EW_Curve3
       EW_Curve3_IOError
       EW_Dataflow_Curve3
       EW_Dataflow_Curve3_Explicit
       EW_Dataflow_Network::cached_curve

       EW_Dig3_Space
       EW_Dig3_View


2010-02-03  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

   * Debugged a subtle problem on Mac OS X: the bundled lapack routines
   occasionally crash if their array arguments are not aligned to 16 bytes.
   This can be ensured by new'ing them or by making them std::vector's.


2010-01-27  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

   * Added EW_Dig3_Space::get_surface_of_pointset.


2010-01-25  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

   * Added:
       EW_Dataflow_Spline3::get_nonsingular
       EW_Dataflow_Surface3::make_index
       EW_Dataflow_Surface3::index_is_made
   Changed and completed:
       EW_Dataflow_Surface3::project
   Renamed:
       EW_Dataflow_Surface3::optimized_lmk_images ->
        EW_Dataflow_Surface3::get_optimized_lmk_images


2010-01-20  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Renamed
        EW_Dataflow_Surface3::get_triangles -> EW_Dataflow_Surface3::get_faces
        EW_Dataflow_Surface3::get_num_triangles ->
         EW_Dataflow_Surface3::get_num_faces


2010-01-19  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Made EW_Dataflow_Network::surface_cached surfaces persist until the
    network is destroyed.

    * Support const EW_Dataflow_Nodes: added a lot of const's to method
    signatures.
    The nodes created by EW_Dig3 are now accessible as pointers to const, so
    they may only be changed using EW_Dig3_Space wrappers.
    This is to clarify what may be done to these nodes.
    Added:
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_form_pointset
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_form_pointset_location
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_form_pointset_relax
        EW_Dig3_Space::remove_form_pointset
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_form_embedding
        EW_Dig3_Space::remove_form_embedding
    and changed:
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_surface -> EW_Dig3_Space::set_form_surface
        EW_Dig3_Space::remove_surface -> EW_Dig3_Space::remove_form_surface
    These functions have the same signatures as the EW_Dataflow_Form3
    equivalents.
    These replace methods removed on 2010-01-07.

    * Changed EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_surface and EW_Dig3_Space::set_surface to
    use a EW_Form3_Surface pointer argument for consistency.

    * Added:
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_volume
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::remove_volume
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_curve
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::remove_curve
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_embedding
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::remove_embedding
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_reflection
      EW_Dataflow_Form3::remove_reflection


2010-01-14  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Various bug fixes.

    * Made EW_View3_Item destructors protected and documented that items
    belong to their widget after creation.
    Added EW_View3_Item::destroy() to use instead of the destructor.

    * Replaced
        EW_Dataflow_Surface3_Explicit::cached ->
         EW_Dataflow_Network::surface_cached


2010-01-12  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Renamed, for consistency:
        EW_Bbox3::set_empty -> EW_Bbox3::set_to_empty


2010-01-07  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added EW_Dig3_Space::get_form_node.
    Removed the following, which this makes redundent:
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_pointset
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_pointset_location
        EW_Dig3_Space::remove_pointset
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_embedding
        EW_Dig3_Space::remove_embedding
    Added EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_pointset_relax.
    Changed:
        EW_Dataflow_Spline3::warp_point -> EW_Dataflow_Spline3::warp_points
    Changed EW_Dataflow_Spline3::optimized_lmk_images to return a pointer to
    the array of coordinates of all optimized landmarks.


2010-01-05  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * All classes now have their own header and source files.
    Client code may need additional include statements.


2009-12-15  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Improved playback interpolation algorithm.


2009-12-14  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Changed signature of EW_Transform3::format and EW_Transform3::scan,
    to be less awkward.


2009-12-11  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Started to add support for more landmark operations.
    These operations can already be performed using existing methods:
        create a EW_Form3_Pointset in the template or specimen
        delete a EW_Form3_Pointset from the template or specimen
        delete all EW_Form3_Pointset's in the template or in the specimen
        add a point to a EW_Form3_Pointset
        delete a point from a EW_Form3_Pointset
        select a point in the template or specimen
        set or change the following attributes of a EW_Form3_Pointset
          id
          type (currently landmark or semi-landmark)
          state
          n
        set or change the following attributes of a point in a EW_Form3_Pointset
          location
          relax_params
          relax_dims (including whether the point should be ignored)
        set all semi-landmarks to be ignored
        set a landmark or semi-landmark to be ignored
        set a landmark or semi-landmark to be not ignored
        copy a EW_Form3_Pointset from the template to the specimen or vice versa
        copy all EW_Form3_Pointset's from the template to the specimen or vice
         versa
        move a point in the specimen to the location it occupies in the
         template or vice versa
        move all points in a EW_From3_Pointset in the specimen to the locations
         they occupy in the template or vice versa
        move all points in the specimen to the locations they occupy in the
         template or vice versa
    These methods have been partially implemented:
        EW_Dig3::get_spline_node
        EW_Dig3_Space::get_surface_nodes
        EW_Dig3_Space::set_embedding
        EW_Dig3_Space::remove_embedding
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::get_energy
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::get_n_lmks
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::get_f_size
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::warp_point
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::lmk_index
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::lmk_pointset
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::lmk_pointset_i
        EW_Dataflow_Spline::optimized_lmk_image
        EW_Dataflow_Surface3_Explicit::project
    They will allow the following additional operations to be performed:
        display information about the spline (number of (semi-)landmarks,
         algebraic dimension, singularity, energy)
        move an ignored landmark or semi-landmark in the specimen to the
         where it is warped from the template
        move all ignored landmarks or semi-landmarks in the specimen to the
         where they are warped from the template
        change a EW_Form3_Pointset in the specimen from "unset" to "warped",
         setting all points to where they are warped from the template
        set or change the surface an EW_Form3_Pointset is embedded in
         move an embedded landmark to its surface
        move a semi-landmark to its surface, display the distance moved, and/or
         set the relax_params and relax_dims of a semi-landmark to the surface
         tangent space
        move all semi-landmarks of a EW_Form3_Pointset to their surface,
         display the average and maximum distance moved, and/or set the
         relax_params and relax_dims of the semi-landmarks to the surface
         tangent spaces
        move all semi-landmarks to their surfaces, display the average and
         maximum distance moved, and/or set the relax_params and relax_dims of
         the semi-landmarks to the surface tangent spaces.
        slide a semi-landmark to the position in its relaxation space that
         minimizes the spline's energy, and display the distance moved
        slide all semi-landmarks to the positions in their relaxation spaces
         that minimize the spline's energy, and display the average and
         maximum distance moved


2009-12-10  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Restructured exception handling to improve exception safety and allow the
    elimination of the warn_stream optional argument of the
    EW_Dataflow_network constructor and of EW_Dataflow_network::get_warned.


2009-11-29  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Fixed misbehviour in the filename handling code.

    * Converted surface faces and points from an array to a vector.
    The efficiency gained from using arrays (around 10%) did not justify the
    amount of code.


2009-11-05  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * All filename fields and arguments are now expected to be canonical
    utf-8 filenames.
    EW_Form3::read_file and EW_Form3::write_file will convert filenames in
    the input/output from/to simple filenames, when appropriate.


2009-11-04  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Removed the form element label field.
    The id will now be used as the label.
    Id's can now contain whitespace.
    This results in a change to the form file format.

    * Included a version number in the form3 and dig3 file formats.


2009-09-17  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Changed "target" to "specimen" in code and tableau file formats.


2009-09-10  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added:
      EW_View3_Widget::set_highlight_color
      EW_View3_Widget::get_highlight_color
      EW_View3_Widget::get_highlight_item
      EW_View3_Widget::clear_highlight
      EW_View3_Landmarks::set_highlight
      EW_View3_Landmarks::get_highlight_ps
      EW_View3_Landmarks::get_highlight_i

    * Added EW_View3_Widget::pick.

    * Changed signature of EW_Dig3_Space::set_pointset.


2009-09-02  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Changed EW_View3_Item linked list into a vector of pointers in
    EW_View3_Widget.
    Removed:
        EW_View3_Widget::get_first_item
        EW_View3_Widget::get_last_item
        EW_View3_Widget::move_item_before
        EW_View3_Widget::move_item_after
        EW_View3_Item::get_next_item
        EW_View3_Item::get_prev_item
    Added:
        EW_View3_Widget::get_items
        EW_View3_Widget::get_n_items
        EW_View3_Widget::move_item
        EW_View3_Item::get_index


2009-08-27  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added EW_Dig3::interpolate_tableau.


2009-08-26  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added
        EW_BBox3
        EW_Dataflow_Surface3::get_bbox
        EW_Dataflow_Landmarks3::get_bbox
        EW_View3_Item::get_bbox
        EW_View3_Widget::get_bbox
        EW_View3_Widget::get_bbox_tr
        EW_Dig3_Space::get_bbox


2009-08-25  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added:
        EW_View3_Widget::get_center_location
        EW_View3_Widget::get_jump_tr

    * Fixed omission in EW_Dig3::load_tableau.


2009-08-24  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Fixed crashing caused by EW_View3_Widget::move_item_before.

    * Fixed failure to load obj files with multiple index f form.

    * Reverted to rendering slice view without depth buffer, as the only
    reliable way to get landmarks to always show up.


2009-08-24  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added, to support landmarks:
        EW_Form3::search_pointset
        EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_pointset
        EW_Dataflow_Form3::set_pointset_location
        EW_Dataflow_Form3::remove_pointset
        EW_View3_Landmarks
        EW_Dig3_Tableau_Space::bool show_lmks_in_main
        EW_Dig3_Tableau_Space::bool show_lmks_in_slice
        EW_Dig3_Tableau_Space::int lmks_symbol
        EW_Dig3_Tableau_Space::unsigned char lmks_col
        EW_Dig3_View::get_landmarks_item
        EW_View3_Widget::get_pointer_location
    and updated:
        EW_Dig3::save_tableau
        EW_Dig3::load_tableau

    * Renamed, to be a little less confusing:
        EW_Dataflow_Form3::unset_surface -> EW_Dataflow_Form3::remove_surface


2009-08-20  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Simplified the form3 file format by merging the very similar point
    and pointset fields.


2009-08-18  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added EW_Dig3_View::get_slice_index()


2009-08-06  Bill Green  <wdkg@wdkg.org>

    * Added class EW_Dig3_Tableau for save files, and related methods in
    EW_Dig3.

    * Added:
        EW_Transform3::scan
        EW_Transform3::format

    * Renamed, to work better with debug message selection:
        EW_Dataflow -> EW_Dataflow_Network
        EW_View3 -> EW_View3_Widget

    * Replaced EW_Dig3_Geom and EW_Dig3_Flat with EW_Dig3, EW_Dig3_Space and
    EW_Dig3_View, to reduce the number of classes an application needs to
    implement and to avoid requiring virtual inheritance.

    * Renamed, to better reflect their purpose:
        EW_Transform2::set_identity -> EW_Transform2::set_to_identity
        EW_Transform2::set_inverse -> EW_Transform2::set_to_inverse
        EW_Transform2::set_composition -> EW_Transform2::set_to_composition
        EW_Transform2::set_interpolation -> EW_Transform2::set_to_interpolation
        EW_Transform2::set_normalization -> EW_Transform2::set_to_normalization
        EW_Transform3::set_identity -> EW_Transform3::set_to_identity
        EW_Transform3::set_inverse -> EW_Transform3::set_to_inverse
        EW_Transform3::set_composition -> EW_Transform3::set_to_composition
        EW_Transform3::set_interpolation -> EW_Transform3::set_to_interpolation
        EW_Transform3::set_normalization -> EW_Transform3::set_to_normalization

    * Renamed in EW_View3_Widget
        EW_View3_Widget::schedule_idle_handler ->
         EW_View3_Widget::schedule_idle_handler_cb
        EW_View3_Widget::redraw -> EW_View3_Widget::redraw_cb

    * Replaced the exception in EW_Transform2/3::set_to_interpolation with a
    return code.

    * Replaced GLuint with unsigned int to avoid exposing OpenGL in interface.

    * Made a depth buffer a requirement in view3_widget.cpp.

    * Replaced use of isspace, printf, sscanf, strtol and strtod for data files
    to avoid locale and library implementation complications.
    Used gdtoa for floating point conversions.

    * Made use of XML_PARSE_COMPACT in dataflow_form3.cpp dependent on
    LIBXML_VERSION for Mac OS X, where the default libxml2 is too old to
    support this.
