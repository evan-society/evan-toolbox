# ET Open Space
The EVAN Toolbox (ET) is a software package developed by the European Virtual Anthropology Network – EVAN (www.evan.at) and the EVAN-Society to facilitate form and shape analysis of objects featuring a complex geometry. It uses Geometric Morphometrics (GM) which includes methods such as General Procrustes Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Thin-Plate Spline Warping or Partial Least Squares Analysis. The software supports data acquisition, i.e. to locate landmarks and semilandmarks on curves and surfaces.

The idea behind the EVAN Toolbox is to make your life easier if your task is to analyse 3D shape and form of complexly shaped objects as we find them, for instance, in biology and medicine. ET is particularly focused on the advanced visualisation of shape and form comparisons. ET interacts with its users in the form of a programmable network in which the operator specifies the flow of information and control among various components, called nodes.

The EVAN Toolbox is intended for research and education purposes. If you use ET for your work, please don’t forget to acknowledge the EVAN Toolbox in the appropriate section of your publication.
